    <!-- Adding Babel to your project
        ->To add Babel to your project, copy and paste the following script in your index.html file: 
        What is JSX?
        JSX is a syntax extension for JavaScript that allows you to describe your UI in a familiar HTML-like syntax. The nice thing about JSX is that apart from following three JSX rules, you don't need to learn any new symbols or syntax outside of HTML and JavaScript.
        But browsers don't understand JSX out of the box, so you'll need a JavaScript compiler, such as a Babel, to transform your JSX code into regular JavaScript.
        -->
    <script src="https://unpkg.com/@babel/standalone/babel.min.js"></script>
    <!-- In addition, you will need to inform Babel what code to transform by changing the script type to type=text/jsx. -->
    <script type="text/jsx">
        const app = document.getElementById('app');
        <!-- Instead of directly manipulating the DOM with plain JavaScript, remove the DOM methods that you had added previously, and add the ReactDOM.createRoot() method to target a specific DOM element and create a root to display your React Components in. Then, add the root.render() method to render your React code to the DOM.
        This will tell React to render our <h1> title inside our #app element. -->

        const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(app);
        root.render(<h1>Develop. Preview. ship. </h1> );
